<h1>6.092 Assignment 6: Modeling a Social Network</h1>

<p>Your assignment is to use your current knowledge
about Java, OOP, and Software Design to model certain aspects of a
simple Social Network. These specifications are intentionally loose in
order to give you creative freedom and to test your problem-solving
skills.</p>

<h2><a name="part1"></a>Part 1: <code>SocialEntity</code> Interface</h2>

<p>The <code>SocialEntity</code> is the basic model for anyone or
anything in the social network.  Every <code>SocialEntity</code> has a
name (<code>String</code>) and a unique ID (<code>long</code>) that can
be accessed only through its <code>getName()</code> and
<code>getId()</code> methods. <em>Note that fields in interfaces are
automatically final and methods are automatically abstract!</em></p>

<h2><a name="part2"></a>Part 2: Subclasses of <code>SocialEntity</code></h2>

<p>Types of <code>SocialEntity</code>s:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Person</code> - has acquaintances : a list of <code>Person</code>,
networks : a list of <code>Network</code>, and a location : <code>String</code></li>

<li><code>Network</code> - members : a list of <code>Person</code></li>

<li><code>Band</code> - fans : a list of <code>Person</code>, description :
<code>String</code>, location : <code>String</code></li>

</ul>

<p>Write the appropriate constructors and methods for each class.  Be
mindful of how and when you initialize or assign each class its fields.
</p>

<h2><a name="part3"></a>Part 3: <code>YourFace</code> Class</h2>

<p>The <code>YourFace</code> class is our entryway into the social
network.  That is, it should have a <code>main</code> method, which
should create seven <code>Person</code>s (each with three acquaintances
and any number of <code>Networks</code>), 
 two <code>Network</code> (each with one or
more member), and two <code>Band</code>s with any number of fans.  After
creating and populating your social network, you should print all the
information about each <code>Person</code> in the network.
</p>

<p>Remember to use encapsulation techniques, follow
other OOP principles mentioned in lecture, and add comments where the
code is doing something that isn't obvious!  Email any questions to <a
href="mailto:iapjava-staff@mit.edu?Subject=6.092 Assignment 7 question">the
staff</a>, and submit your solution on Stellar as usual. Remember to include all your Java files!
