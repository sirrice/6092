= Installing Java and Eclipse

To write Java programs, you need two things: the Java Development Kit (JDK), and
a source code editor. Please follow the directions in this document before the
first class, so you can get started on the first assignment faster. If you run
into difficulty, we can help you during the first class.

The Java Development Kit contains the tools needed to compile and run Java
programs. The source code editor lets you write programs, and has features to
make this easier. For this course, you can use any tool you like, but we
recommend Eclipse, and will demonstrate it during the first lecture.

== Editors

To write programs, you need a piece of software called an editor. They come in
two flavors: simple source code editors, or complex integrated development
environments. For this course, we recommend using the Eclipse Integrated
Development Environment (IDE), but it is useful to be aware of the options that
are available to you.

=== Source Code Editors

A source code editor is a program for editing text, like a word processor, but
it has features which make it easier to read and write computer programs. An
advantage of using a plain source code editor is that they are usually
lightweight applications that are easy to learn and use. Additionally, the
editors typically support many programming languages, so you can use the same
tool for all your work. The disadvantage is that you will need to use the
command line to run the compiler, and to organize larger projects.

For Windows, some popular source code editors are

free version]), or http://www.jedit.org/[jEdit]. Mac users might want to look

http://www.jedit.org/[jEdit]. (_Note_: some of these are trial versions of
software that you need to purchase).


=== Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Most professional Java developers use an integrated development environment
(IDE), which combines a source code editor with other tools for software
development. They make it easy to find and correct errors, and to accomplish
tasks through a graphical interface, instead of the command line. In this class,
we recommend using http://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse]. Other popular IDEs for Java
include http://netbeans.org/[NetBeans] and
http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA].


== Windows
=== Install the Sun Java 6 JDK

You want to install the Java Standard Edition (SE) development kit (JDK). You
can find this through Oracle's
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java
download site], but follow these directions for the direct link:

. Go to the
https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=jdk-6u23-oth-JPR@CDS-CDS_Developer[Java SE Development Kit (JDK)]
download page.
. Under Platform, select Windows.
. Check "I agree."
. Click Continue.
. Click the file name on the next page (something like jdk-6u23-windows-i586.exe).
. Follow your browser's directions to download the file, then run the
installer. Accept the default settings.


=== Install Eclipse

You want the Eclipse IDE for Java developers. You can find this on the
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse download site], but follow these
directions for the direct link:

. Download the
http://mirrors.med.harvard.edu/eclipse/technology/epp/downloads/release/helios/SR1/eclipse-java-helios-SR1-win32.zip[Eclipse
IDE for Java developers].
. Open the zip file that you downloaded. It contains a single folder named
+eclipse+.
. Move the +eclipse+ folder by dragging it somewhere you can find it again.
The typical location is +C:\Program Files+, but the Desktop works as well. You
may want to rename the folder to +Eclipse+.
. Open the folder and start Eclipse by double clicking on +eclipse.exe+.
. _Optional_: To make it easy to find in the future, create a shortcut from
+eclipse.exe+ your Desktop, and rename it +Eclipse+ (drag with the right
mouse button to create a shortcut).


== Mac OS X

Mac OS X comes with the Java development tools. Run Software Update to ensure
that you have the latest version installed (Apple Menu -> Software Update).

=== Install Eclipse

. Download the http://mirrors.med.harvard.edu/eclipse/technology/epp/downloads/release/helios/SR1/eclipse-java-helios-SR1-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.tar.gz[Eclipse
IDE for Java developers].
. Open the archive file that you downloaded (Safari may have expanded it
automatically for you).
. Drag and drop the +eclipse+ folder anywhere you want it (your Desktop may
be a good place).
. Run Eclipse by double clicking the +Eclipse+ application inside the +eclipse+
folder.


=== Linux

If you are using Linux, you probably don't need our help to get Java and
Eclipse running yourself. If you do need help, ask one of the instructors during
the first lecture.
