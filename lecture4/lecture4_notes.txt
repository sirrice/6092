 constructor
  with arguments
 creating an instance
 references and values
 static vs nonstatic 


LECTURE 5 TOPICS
 review
   - look at a class w/ fields, constructors, 
 access control - public /private/protected?
 finding names - scope
 packages
  special packages - java.lang
  imports
 java API
 Object arrays
 Collections
  ArrayList
  Set
   TreeSet
	 HashSet
  Map
	 TreeMap
	 HashMap


Review
 solutions
 Issues
  array index vs value
  braces for loops
  method declared within methods (will talk about it later)
  variable initialization (for 2nd fastest)
  
Debugging notes
 printlns
 ctrl-shift-f

Introduce OOP
 represent real world
 builds on primitives and other objects
  group attributes together
 Motivation of classes
  example of representing an object using _only_ primitives
  example of a class of only primitives

Introduce classes and objects
  difference between the two
  blueprint vs house
 example of a class
 example of an object _instance_

Introduce a field only class
 Car
  license
  speed
  maxspeed

Initialize it
 Car batmobile = new Car()

Access a field
 print batmobile.speed
 batmobile.speed = 50

Methods - keep the public static
 public static void floorIt()

Call the method
 batmobile.floorIt()

Method with argument
 public static void printSpeedAsPhrase()
  if speed == 0: print 
  elif speed < 50: print cruisin
  elif speed > 100: print blazin
  else: print speeding

Constructor
 special syntax
 arguments

References and values
 recap - objects and primitives
 passing objects and setting objects
  pictures!!!
  array is an object

 
static 
 doesn't act on the instance - how to get this across?
nonstatic
 can reference static fields/methods, not the other way around
 what does java know?
